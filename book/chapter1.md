# Technology Commercialization

## Porblem Statement

- Existing commercialization methods for bringing ideas to market are lagging behind. 
They focus on innovation and entrepreneurship to address specific problems. As a result,
although we have a lot of ideas and visions, the odds of success remain low.

- There is a misconception that bringing ideas to market requires stating a company.

- The world is changing (see [The Flat World is Flat by T. Friedman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1911.The_World_Is_Flat)).
Old methods will no longer work in the new world.

## Solution

- We can improve the odds of success by devising a process.

- Ideas can come from a myriad of places (e.g. invention, acquisitions, licensing, etc).
