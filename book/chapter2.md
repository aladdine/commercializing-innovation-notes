# Chapter 2: The Commercialization Model

# Overview

Instead of relying on entrepreneurship and innovation, a model (or process) allows for:
- effective means of sharing ideas, 
- a platform for measuring progress and outcome effectiveness,
- a more efficient allocation of resources,
- a component of “learning” that improves outcomes through continuous feedback,
- discipline (e.g. a pilot checklist).
